		<h3>Homework #1</h3>
		<p>The first homework is meant to help us get to know each other in the first class. It will also get you started in thinking about data!</p>
		<p>Please come to class #1 with a piece of numerical data that describes something about your background, your life, or your interests. This assignment is asking you to quantify some aspect of your personal life.</p>
		<p>Some basic examples might be: 
			<ul>
				<li>the number of books, or sneakers, or T-shirts you own</li>
				<li>the time (in days) since you graduated university</li>
				<li>the price (in shillings) of your favorite meal at your favorite restaurant</li>
				<li>the distance (in kilometers) you live from your birth place</li>
				<li>the win/loss record of your favorite football team</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Pick something that tells people something about yourself, and is unique to you!</p>
