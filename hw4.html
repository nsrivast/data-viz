		<h3>Homework #4 - Due July 7th</h3>
		<p>Please email me a proposal for your final project by Tuesday, July 7th. If you are doing an advanced visualization or you will be missing any upcoming classes, try to send me the proposal earlier so I can give you feedback after class.</p>
		<p>The proposal should include the following:
			<ul>
				<li>What is the purpose of the visualization? What message are you trying to convey?</li>
				<li>What are the user questions you will answer, or the user activities you will support?</li>
				<li>What is your data source?</li>
				<li>Do you want to work with a partner, and if so - do you have one in mind?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>This proposal is not final - your idea can change over time as you explore your data and come up with new ideas.</strong></p>
		<p>Please also bring your laptop for the next class, and your payment if you have not already given it.</p>
