		<h3>Homework #5 - Due July 9th</h3>
		<p>Please prepare a final proposal for your data visualization project by Thursday, July 9th. This should reflect our conversation in class on Tuesday, and include answers to the following questions:
			<ul>
				<li>What is the message of the visualization? What are the user tasks or questions you are answering?</li>
				<li>What is the exact data source? This should not be a complex database but the specific fields and items that will be included in your final visualization. (Email me a link to the data, or include sample data.)</li>
				<li>Which visual channels and chart types do you plan on using in your visualization? Provide a written summary or a hand-drawn sketch.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Please take some time to think in detail about your data and design. It will save you time during the implementation and building.</strong></p>
